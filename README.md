### Hi there! 😊 I'm Mar!
---
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a web developer and computer engineer with a keen eye for detail.

## 🌱 Currently working on:
- Finishing my Bachelor's degree
- Updating a web application with Symfony.
- Creating my personal website to showcase my projects and skills.

## 👩🏻 About me:
I’m really passionate about learning and always looking for ways to improve my knowledge and skills. Whether it’s picking up new programming languages or diving into the latest tech trends, I enjoy the challenge of growing and improving every day.

In my free time, I love to cook, and I’m also really into sports, which help me stay active and motivated. When I want to relax, you’ll usually find me reading, whether it’s something tech-related, a personal development book, or just a good story to unwind.

## 🔧 Technologies I use:
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Ionic, Angular, TypeScript
- **Backend**: PHP, Symfony (currently learning), Java
- **Databases**: MySQL
- **Other**: GitLab, Figma

  - ### Fun fact:
At 18, I explored the world of pastry and bakery, working in various bakeries for almost five years. Eventually, my passion for technology led me to transition into web development, where I now combine creativity and technical skills. 🍰💻
